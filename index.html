			 <p>Generally people flood your inbox or timelines with Top &ldquo;X&rdquo; of the Year lists at the beginning of the month. I&rsquo;m even guilty of <a href="https://mindofaaronw.com/2023/01/09/aarons-top-of.html">this for movies</a> this year. But for music, I&rsquo;ve never been able to take on that tall task and narrow down a list like that.</p>
<p>Music is different I guess. I adore music - it is incredibly important and meaningful to me. To create a best albums of 2022 list would not only be impossible, but also unfair to all the artists and musicians I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to listen to. Instead I&rsquo;m going to try something else and provide a list of albums that I couldn&rsquo;t get out of my head last year, why they were on repeat, what format I listened to it in, and anything else I feel like sharing. The kicker? They don&rsquo;t have to be released in 2022.</p>
<p>2022 was a great year for me music wise.</p>
<ul>
<li>It was the first year my wife and I really ventured out post-pandemic to experience the Austin music scene. We attended several concerts around the Austin area, went to ACL Live tapings, and attended our first Austin City Limits Festival.</li>
<li>I challenged myself to listen to things I wouldn&rsquo;t normally to, and I discovered artists such as Gilberto Gil, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Scary Pockets, and Daniel Johnston (to name a few).</li>
<li>I also kept exploring my favorite genres of classic country, rock and alternative rock, blues and blues-rock, folk, and Americana. This is what I grew up with and what I will always return to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without further delay, here is the music that shaped my 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Tai Verdes</strong>: One of the non-headliners my wife and I were most excited to see at ACL Festival. Tai Verdes is an upbeat R&amp;B singer whose songs are incredibly catchy and dance-able. But behind the lyrics you can get find deeper meaning, but also inspiration. His <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/tv/1565280120">album <em>TV</em> </a> is my favorite, but he also released <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/hdtv/1640571596"><em>HDTV</em></a> in September 2022. If you are looking for a feel good time with a surprising theme every now and then, I can&rsquo;t recommend him enough.</p>
<p><strong>Jamestown Revival</strong>: Longtime favorite of mine is the duo that is Jamestown Revival. They fit in the singer/songwriter or folk genre.  <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/young-man/1584875794"><em>Young Man</em></a> was released in January 2022 and was one I had preordered on vinyl (I own all of their albums on vinyl). Any time I put one of their records on, I find myself with a sense of wanderlust and wish that I was on a mountain or around a campfire with friends. Another &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; artist that I find myself navigating towards.</p>
<p><strong>The Arc Angels</strong>: I hadn&rsquo;t heard of the Arc Angels before 2022, but I am a sucker for good blues and they are what you&rsquo;d call a blues &ldquo;supergroup&rdquo;. They began playing shows again in 2022 and I saw them live here in Austin. The talent on that stage was breathtaking - to be expected from members of Stevie Ray Vaughan&rsquo;s and Bob Dylan&rsquo;s bands. I found myself lost in guitar solos and medleys all night. They played almost every song off their <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/arc-angels/1440917664">one and only self-titled album</a>, but <em>Sweet Nadine</em> stole the show. Many blues and blues-rock artists today were influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughan and his band, and I&rsquo;m thankful these guys got back together to continue the tradition of great blues in Austin.</p>
<p><strong>Ryuichi Sakamoto</strong>: I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit I&rsquo;ve never really given classical music or composers a chance in my listening rotation. At the end of the year I discovered Ryuichi&rsquo;s album <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/async/1507014129"><em>async</em></a>, a unique, mind bending display of sound. He distorts and creates sounds in interesting ways. I started with <em>async</em> and have had <em>12</em> on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/12/1653999635">as I write this</a>. If you enjoy famous composers from films or people who can manipulate sound, give him a shot. He&rsquo;s also part of Yellow Magic Orchestra which I have yet to dive into.</p>
<p><strong>Zach Bryan</strong>: I discovered Zach Bryan in spring of 2022 through a radio station here in Austin. He became my most listened to artist <em>and</em> <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-heartbreak/1620257596">album</a> of the year, and instantly one of my favorite artists. Some people will say his songs all sound similar, or that he&rsquo;s not modern country enough - I can see why they might think that. <strong>But</strong> what they are missing is the incredible songwriter that he is. To me, Zach Bryan&rsquo;s music is raw and real, as if he is speaking directly to the listener. I connect to his music in different ways each and every time that I listen. The album <em>American Heartbreak</em> is simultaneously a reflection on my own youth and past, as well as my future and what I still want to do. You won&rsquo;t find the modern &ldquo;pop country&rdquo; Nashville sound in Zach&rsquo;s music. In fact, he is actively against <a href="https://variety.com/2022/music/news/zach-bryan-cma-awards-wants-no-part-nominations-snub-1235429943/">that establishment</a> and the other establishment that is <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/zach-bryan-concert-tour-tickets-ticketmaster-1234654016/">Ticketmaster</a>. Instead, I hope you will find something refreshing amidst the typical Nashville sound of trucks, beer, and girls. Yes, there is some of that, but you will also find songs about heartbreak, losing a parent, life and growing up, and everything inbetween. The latter is what is missing from modern country - Zach Bryan is trying to change that, and I love his music because of it.</p>

The argument is that we sometimes get caught up in finding the perfect job (or really anything) instead of just <strong>settling</strong> a bit and putting that extra energy into the things we actually care about (family, health, etc.).</p>
<p>A nice reminder to pause and take a look at your life sometimes and re-prioritize what matters to you. I don&rsquo;t make a ton of money working in the public sector, <em>but</em> that allows me to have great work/life balance. I tend to forget about that balance sometimes, and this was a nice reminder to focus and put energy in the appropriate places.</p>

			 <p>As an Evernote user I gave Obsidian a heartfelt try over Q4 of 2022. Here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve gone back to Evernote as of this week.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-didnt-like">What I didn&rsquo;t like:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Obsidian is <strong>too</strong> complex. There are plugins on top of plugins to customize Obsidian for pretty much every single use case. I found this getting in the way too often and instead of getting things done, I was spending time learning how to make it work within Obsidian. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>While it is nice the plugins are open source and hosted on Github, it is cumbersome to go to each Github repository to learn about the plugin and how to change it to your liking. Obsidian needs better plugin support within the UI itself. This is partially on the plugin developer, but Obsidian should put an emphasis on making this easier. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Adding files - in particular PDFs - to notes just never worked great and looked great when viewing the file. I like other productivity systems/apps handling of PDFs much better.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-i-liked">What I liked:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Markdown support. Markdown makes sense, it is easy to learn, and compatible with more and more apps every day. I know there are ways to make Markdown work natively in Evernote, but I will miss the simplicity of having it work natively in the text editor like it does in Obsidian. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Files sizes are small and storing everything as a .txt file is amazing. This makes it so easy to move your files from one cloud provider to another. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Obsidian is free and has a massive developer community. This is good because there is likely someone who has the same use case as you and created a plugin for it. But for general note taking and <em>Second Brain</em> capturing, I just don&rsquo;t think Obsidian is for me.</li>
</ol>

			<h1><a href="https://mindofaaronw.com/2023/01/22/how-a-book.html">How a book about baseball inspires us to follow our passions</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://mindofaaronw.com/2023/01/22/how-a-book.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-22 10:38:56 -0600">Jan 22, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A <a href="https://mindofaaronw.com/2023/01/20/finished-reading-shoeless.html">few days ago</a>, I finished reading <em>Shoeless Joe</em>, the book that inspired the film, <em>Field of Dreams</em>. Here are some deeper thoughts on a film and book that have helped to shape my world view:</p>
<p>As a baseball fan, Field of Dreams is at the top of my list for baseball films that showcase the love of the game. It goes without saying then that I would eventually find my way to the novel that inspired the film.</p>
<p>Shoeless Joe is different from the film in many ways, but at its core it is about a man who is called to follow his passion. And that has always been what has resonated with me. We can go through life just biding time, or we can choose to take risks and build baseball fields in Iowa cornfields. I hope to be like Ray and to watch others come follow their passions with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll end with one of my favorite quotes from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wish I had your passion for baseball,” Salinger says. “However misdirected it may be, it is still a passion. If I had my life to live over again, I’d take more chances. I’d want more passion in my life. Less fear and more passion, more risk. Even if you fail, you’ve still taken a risk.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One goal of mine for 2023 is to prioritize getting outside more. Whether that’s through hiking, camping, or just traveling and immersing myself into new cultures. Austin has ample options for the first two, and we have a trip planned to Italy in the spring. The year is off to a good first quarter for this goal!</p>
