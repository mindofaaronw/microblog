				"content_text": "<p>After many months of debating, I finally deleted my Twitter/X and Snapchat accounts. I am trying to prioritize aspects of my life and time wasted is at the top of that list. I’ve spent several hours curating my devices notifications, installed apps, and what each device’s purpose should be.</p>\n<p>I thought it would be very difficult at first, but I’m now more conscious of where I focus my time. For example, I am deliberately going to sites to find sports news, or deliberately reaching out to friends to see what they are up to. It seems pretentious to state that I am cool and deliberate with reaching out to friends, but social media is a massive time suck.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, I also started the book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DBRBP7G?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07DBRBP7G&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2\">D</a></em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DBRBP7G?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07DBRBP7G&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2\"><em>igital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World </em>by Cal Newport</a> shortly after deleting these accounts. It’s a great read, but it’s hard to buy into <strong>everything</strong> since Newport was never a big social media user to begin with.</p>\n<p>I’m trying to spend more time on the things I love doing: reading, walking (with or without the dog), taking photos and inspiring my small creative side, meeting and having experiences with my family and friends. Newport’s book is at the very least a reminder to do these things.</p>\n<p>I continue to juggle the responsibilities of adulthood, even over a decade into it, and prioritization of life outside of work is something I’ve always struggled with. Level-setting like this is important - this type of reflection that helps me step back and say “Hey, you are wasting a ton of time, you’re not present with the other things that matter.” As I inch toward my 34th birthday this summer, I can’t help but think I’m finally “growing up” and I’m excited for what is to come.</p>\n",

I couldn't tell if I actually even liked it. But I couldn't look away. It is mesmerizing, haunting, and the cinematography is top notch. What Jonathan Glazer does here is deserving of all the praise reaped on it in 2013. Yet, this is definitely not for everyone - I'm still struggling to figure out if I enjoyed it. But it really makes you think and unnerves you.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "Inspired by a [recent post of Eric’s](https://ericgregorich.com/2023/04/01/apps-im-using.html), I wanted to take a stab at it for my iPhone. I consider myself a tinkerer of my digital workspace; constantly trying new things or ways I accomplish tasks. Apps are a large part of that, whether on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, or Windows.\n\nHere are my homescreen apps for April 2023. There are a few folders on the right hand side of frequently used apps or new apps I want to try out. I always keep one page too, everything else can be found via Spotlight Search. \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/96354/2023/1e3c08fc34.jpg\" width=\"311\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\n## Widgets\nI have a SmartRotating stack with:\n\n* Calendar\n* Reminders - only showing those with a deadline of Today\n* Weather\n* Fitness \n* Battery\n\n## 1st Row\n* [Bear](https://bear.app/) - personal notes, highlights, knowledge management. Using the 2.0 TestFlight right now.\n* [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) - I am using the TestFlight of the official app. \n* [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io/) - my Reddit client of choice. Wonderful app with tons of customization. I’ve been an Ultra user for a couple years now.\n* Photography folder:\n  * Instagram\n  * Lightroom Mobile - Been using it more and more since subscribing earlier this year. It’s a great way to perform quick edits.\n  * Apple Photos - I sync all photos to Lightroom/Adobe cloud. I then backup photos and documents monthly to external hard drive. Everything else stays in Apple Photos for redundancy (for now).\n\n## 2nd Row\n* Safari - browser of choice on all Apple devices, Chrome on Windows.\n* [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) - RSS reader for websites, blogs, etc.\n* [Artifact](https://artifact.news/) - been testing it for news. I like the app for the most part, but I hate the new Reddit-like features. Might just stick to RSS and Socials if they’re going to prioritize this.\n* Audio folder:\n  * [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) - The silence shortening is unmatched.\n  * Apple Music - It fills my needs and works well enough. The UI does need some work though.\n  * Audible - For audiobooks. I have a large backlog, but I’d prefer to move away from Audible in the future.

The best app for accurate schedules. Using free version currently, but have used paid in the past.\n* Ring - For home security.\n* Utilities folder:\n  * Reminders\n  * Files\n  * [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) - I still use Pocket for my RIL service. Just works cross platform and I don’t mind their recommendations. If I stop using Artifact, I will move Pocket to its place.\n  * Calculator\n  * Wallet\n  * [Just Press Record](https://www.openplanetsoftware.com/just-press-record/) - good for when I’m driving and have a thought or need to remember something and can’t type it out (Don’t text and drive!).

				"content_html": "<p>As I grow older each passing summer, I try my best to reflect upon how I’ve grown, the things I’ve learned, or how my perspective has shifted throughout the year. I’m bad at capturing this into words though. My goal for the year is to become a consistent with journaling, but also to write things down to revisit as I grow. Here’s my attempt at documenting profound, interesting, or impactful things from my 32nd year on this planet.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Savor the little things with those important to you.</strong> Life can be brutally short sometimes, so savor what little time you have with loved ones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Always continue learning.</strong> I’ve gone to college twice; I <em>love</em> to learn. I think it makes you a better and more interesting person. But it can also lead you to experience and have conversations you may not have thought of. Investing in your own learning will pay off too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be kind, no matter what.</strong> You never know what someone else is going through in their own life. It isn’t worth it to get mad at the waiter when your drink isn’t refilled fast enough, or when someone cuts you off while driving. These little annoyances are just that - annoying. Your kindness will go a long way to someone who is struggling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t be afraid to put a book down</strong>. <a href=\"https://mindofaaronw.com/books/\">I love reading</a>, but as I grow older I have abandoned more and more books. I give it roughly 15-20% and if I’m not into it, I move on. My book backlog is always growing, there is always more to read (or watch, or listen to, etc. This doesn’t have to apply to just books!).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stop and pet the dog.</strong> In my opinion, most people are friendly and will strike up casual conversations. No more so than dog owners or people doing something they love. So ask them about their dog, the flower they are planting, or whatever their hobby may be (do not be creepy). Just strike up those casual conversations, you may even make a friend out of it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Put your best effort forward.</strong> Don’t just do the bare minimum to get by. Put out your best work both for yourself and for your employer. You’ll feel better about your output and get a sense of accomplishment. And hopefully your employer will reward you for putting out consistent work. If you work for yourself, this is even more important. Be proud of your output!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Get outside more.</strong> Get out of the house or the office. You will get some vitamin D, stretch your legs and maybe work up a sweat, and see something beautiful. It also <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/201404/why-does-walking-stimulate-creative-thinking\">stimulates creativity</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sing loudly, and dance till your feet hurt.</strong> I am by no means a good dancer. I even refused to dance for most of my life and probably missed out on some fun times. But as I grow older I find myself dancing more, especially at weddings. I don’t really care if people think I look stupid doing it. Go have fun, lead your spouse or your date to the dance floor. And sing loudly while you’re at it. Life is short, go have fun while you can still move around.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>There’s more to life than work.</strong> I’ve never been a classic “workaholic” but between moving across the country during a pandemic, being unemployed during parts of the pandemic, and going back to school to change careers, I’ve discovered that my family and friends are a lot more important than whatever job I have. I’m not saying don’t have passions and aspirations with your career. Rather, don’t let your identity be your career and climbing the ladder. Find balance and hobbies and a good circle of support. And if you love work, that’s okay too. It just doesn’t have to be your identity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You can always improve yourself.</strong> I’ve been married almost 4 years now (not long I know), but throughout my life I’ve figured out that it is difficult to get others to change - it is much easier to change yourself. Take a step back, figure out why you react this way, or why that matters to you. Evaluate what’s important to you and if it’s worth fighting for or not. If it isn’t, change yourself and grow from these lessons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Find a system that works for you.</strong> This is in regards to your organization and productivity. I’ve spent way too much time trying countless apps, tools, and systems, trying to mold my system to fit the latest trend. Don’t do that. If pen and paper works for you, great! Keep doing that. Just make sure you’re getting your tasks and work done instead of playing around with new ways to track your work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Real friends will help you move.</strong> If you’ve ever moved, you know how awful and tiring that process can be. A good gauge of who your real friends are, is who volunteers to help and who agrees when you ask. The ones that make up excuses aren’t the ones you want to surround yourself with.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It’s okay to do nothing.</strong> I quite enjoy my silence and solitude. I take public transit half the week for this reason - I can decompress after work and zone out. It also is a great way to catch up on podcasts, audiobooks, or music I’ve wanted to listen to. “Me time” is okay, in fact I’d argue it’s necessary. Don’t be afraid to take it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Have your own interests.</strong> My wife and I don’t share all the same interests, and that’s okay. You don’t have to do everything together with your spouse. That doesn’t mean your relationship is failing. However, this isn’t an excuse to not spend quality time together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Spend more time with your parents.</strong> As I grow older I tend to drift away from my parents both literally and as I have my own careers and family. I&rsquo;m now halfway across the country from mine, and I put every effort to call each parent individually throughout the week on my commute home. They aren&rsquo;t getting younger or healthier, so it falls on us as their children to prioritize quality time with them. Do it. You will regret it later if you don&rsquo;t.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This was very challenging for me to write, and I feel very vulnerable sharing it all. I hope you get something out of it or at least stop and think of a new perspective!</p>\n<p>P.S. It is not my birthday till August, but I felt like getting this out now 😁.</p>\n",

This is what I grew up with and what I will always return to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without further delay, here is the music that shaped my 2022.</p>\n<p><strong>Tai Verdes</strong>: One of the non-headliners my wife and I were most excited to see at ACL Festival. Tai Verdes is an upbeat R&amp;B singer whose songs are incredibly catchy and dance-able. But behind the lyrics you can get find deeper meaning, but also inspiration. His <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/tv/1565280120\">album <em>TV</em> </a> is my favorite, but he also released <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/hdtv/1640571596\"><em>HDTV</em></a> in September 2022. If you are looking for a feel good time with a surprising theme every now and then, I can&rsquo;t recommend him enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamestown Revival</strong>: Longtime favorite of mine is the duo that is Jamestown Revival. They fit in the singer/songwriter or folk genre.  <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/young-man/1584875794\"><em>Young Man</em></a> was released in January 2022 and was one I had preordered on vinyl (I own all of their albums on vinyl). Any time I put one of their records on, I find myself with a sense of wanderlust and wish that I was on a mountain or around a campfire with friends. Another &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; artist that I find myself navigating towards.</p>\n<p><strong>The Arc Angels</strong>: I hadn&rsquo;t heard of the Arc Angels before 2022, but I am a sucker for good blues and they are what you&rsquo;d call a blues &ldquo;supergroup&rdquo;. They began playing shows again in 2022 and I saw them live here in Austin. The talent on that stage was breathtaking - to be expected from members of Stevie Ray Vaughan&rsquo;s and Bob Dylan&rsquo;s bands. I found myself lost in guitar solos and medleys all night. They played almost every song off their <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/arc-angels/1440917664\">one and only self-titled album</a>, but <em>Sweet Nadine</em> stole the show. Many blues and blues-rock artists today were influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughan and his band, and I&rsquo;m thankful these guys got back together to continue the tradition of great blues in Austin.</p>\n<p><strong>Ryuichi Sakamoto</strong>: I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit I&rsquo;ve never really given classical music or composers a chance in my listening rotation. At the end of the year I discovered Ryuichi&rsquo;s album <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/async/1507014129\"><em>async</em></a>, a unique, mind bending display of sound. He distorts and creates sounds in interesting ways. I started with <em>async</em> and have had <em>12</em> on <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/12/1653999635\">as I write this</a>. If you enjoy famous composers from films or people who can manipulate sound, give him a shot. He&rsquo;s also part of Yellow Magic Orchestra which I have yet to dive into.</p>\n<p><strong>Zach Bryan</strong>: I discovered Zach Bryan in spring of 2022 through a radio station here in Austin. He became my most listened to artist <em>and</em> <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-heartbreak/1620257596\">album</a> of the year, and instantly one of my favorite artists. Some people will say his songs all sound similar, or that he&rsquo;s not modern country enough - I can see why they might think that. <strong>But</strong> what they are missing is the incredible songwriter that he is. To me, Zach Bryan&rsquo;s music is raw and real, as if he is speaking directly to the listener. I connect to his music in different ways each and every time that I listen. The album <em>American Heartbreak</em> is simultaneously a reflection on my own youth and past, as well as my future and what I still want to do. You won&rsquo;t find the modern &ldquo;pop country&rdquo; Nashville sound in Zach&rsquo;s music. In fact, he is actively against <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/music/news/zach-bryan-cma-awards-wants-no-part-nominations-snub-1235429943/\">that establishment</a> and the other establishment that is <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/zach-bryan-concert-tour-tickets-ticketmaster-1234654016/\">Ticketmaster</a>. Instead, I hope you will find something refreshing amidst the typical Nashville sound of trucks, beer, and girls. Yes, there is some of that, but you will also find songs about heartbreak, losing a parent, life and growing up, and everything inbetween. The latter is what is missing from modern country - Zach Bryan is trying to change that, and I love his music because of it.</p>\n",
